        <h2>HOW DO CUSTOM DOMAINS AND JOB DISTRIBUTION WORK?</h2>
        <p>
          Flowxtra enables employers to connect their own domains or Flowxtra-hosted subdomains to
          publish job listings. When a customer uses this feature, the customer is solely responsible
          for the accuracy, legality, and compliance of each posting, including adherence to local labor
          laws, advertising rules, and platform terms of service.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the customer's instruction, Flowxtra may syndicate job listings and related metadata to
          external job boards or social networks (for example LinkedIn, Meta/Facebook, Instagram,
          X/Twitter, Google Jobs, Snapchat, Discord servers, WhatsApp Channels, Telegram, or other
          regional aggregators). Flowxtra also provides Social Media Manager tools that allow customers
          to publish posts and content directly to these and other social media platforms (including
          TikTok, Google Business Profiles, and similar destinations). These third-party channels have
          their own policies, and the customer must ensure that each posting and social media content
          complies with those requirements. Flowxtra may edit, pause, or refuse to distribute any job
          advertisement or social media content that violates a partner platform's policies or our Legal
          Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          When job distribution is enabled, we process and share the content of the job listing (title,
          description, location, salary range, hiring company details, and contact methods) with the
          selected platforms. If a customer chooses to collect applications directly on those platforms,
          the partner may also receive candidate information. The lawful basis for this processing is
          the performance of the contract with the customer (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR) and, where required,
          the explicit consent of the candidate. Customers must provide any required notices or obtain
          consent from candidates before enabling third-party distribution.
        </p>
        <p>The following table summarises the respective responsibilities:</p>
        <table>
          <thead>

          to ensure postings remain compliant with content, anti-spam, and platform-specific rules.

        <h2>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is
          necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable
          law, such as your consent, compliance with laws, performance of a contract, protection of
          your rights, or our legitimate business interests.
        </p>

        <h3>If you are located in the EU or UK</h3>
        <p>
          The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the legal
          bases we rely on to process your personal information. We may rely on the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Consent:</strong> We process your information if you have given us permission for
            a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time (see “What Are Your Privacy
            Rights?”).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performance of a Contract:</strong> We process personal information to fulfil our
            contractual obligations to you, including providing Services or taking steps at your
            request prior to entering into a contract.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> We process information when it is reasonably
            necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not
            override your rights and freedoms. For example:
            <ul>
              <li>Sending information about special offers and discounts</li>
              <li>Developing and displaying personalised advertising content</li>
              <li>Analysing how the Services are used to improve engagement and retention</li>
              <li>Supporting marketing activities</li>
              <li>Diagnosing problems or preventing fraudulent activities</li>
              <li>Understanding how users interact with products and Services</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may process information to comply with legal
            obligations, such as cooperating with law enforcement, exercising or defending legal
            rights, or producing records in litigation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Vital Interests:</strong> We may process information to protect your vital
            interests or those of a third party, such as preventing harm.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>If you are located in Canada</h3>
        <p>
          We may process your information if you have given specific (express) consent or in cases
          where your permission can be inferred (implied consent). You can withdraw consent at any
          time. In limited cases, Canadian law permits processing without consent, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>When collection is clearly in an individual’s interest and consent cannot be obtained quickly</li>
          <li>For investigations and fraud detection or prevention</li>
          <li>For business transactions, provided certain conditions are met</li>
          <li>When contained in a witness statement and needed to assess or settle insurance claims</li>
          <li>To identify injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicate with next of kin</li>
          <li>If there are reasonable grounds to believe someone may be a victim of financial abuse</li>
          <li>
            When obtaining consent would compromise the availability or accuracy of the information
            and collection is reasonable for investigating breaches or contraventions of law
          </li>
          <li>When disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, or court order</li>
          <li>
            If produced in the course of employment, business, or profession and consistent with its
            original purpose
          </li>
          <li>When collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
          <li>When the information is publicly available and specified by regulation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. DO WE OFFER ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED PRODUCTS?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>In Short:</strong> We use AI to assist with recruitment workflows—not to make hiring
          decisions. All employment decisions remain under full human control by the hiring organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Services include AI-powered features ("AI Products") designed to streamline recruitment
          processes and improve efficiency. Flowxtra is a human-first Applicant Tracking System (ATS)
          that complies with the EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689), GDPR, and applicable employment laws.
        </p>

        <h3>What Our AI Does</h3>
        <p>Flowxtra's AI is used exclusively for the following recruitment support tasks:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Job posting creation:</strong> AI assists HR teams in drafting and optimizing job descriptions and social media posts</li>
          <li><strong>Communication assistance:</strong> AI helps generate email templates and responses to streamline candidate communications</li>
          <li><strong>Job distribution automation:</strong> AI automates posting jobs to platforms like LinkedIn, Google Jobs, and other job boards</li>
          <li><strong>Data search and filtering:</strong> AI helps employers search their candidate database faster (e.g., finding candidates with specific skills like "PHP developer" or "cybersecurity experience")</li>
          <li><strong>Translation services:</strong> AI translates job postings and communications across multiple languages</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Our AI Does NOT Do</h3>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Flowxtra does not use AI for automated decision-making in hiring. Specifically, our AI does not:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Score, rank, or rate candidates</li>
          <li>Recommend or select "the best candidate"</li>
          <li>Perform automated profiling, matching, or filtering of applicants</li>
          <li>Make or influence hiring, interview, or rejection decisions</li>
          <li>Access or process sensitive personal data such as photos, gender, nationality, ethnicity, religion, or place of birth</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All hiring decisions—including who to interview, shortlist, or hire—are made exclusively by
          human recruiters or HR professionals within the hiring organization. Flowxtra's AI serves only
          as a productivity tool to accelerate administrative tasks.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Isolation and Multi-Tenant Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          Flowxtra operates a multi-tenant system where each company has its own isolated database.
          Candidate data (including names, emails, CVs, and applications) is accessible only to the
          hiring organization that posted the job. Flowxtra does not access, view, or analyze individual
          candidate data except for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Job posting title and URL (to monitor compliance with Austrian, EU, US, Canadian, and Australian employment laws)</li>
          <li>Technical support requests explicitly initiated by the customer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our AI does not train on your candidate data, and we do not use candidate information for any
          purpose beyond providing the Services to your organization.
        </p>

        <h3>Compliance with EU AI Act and GDPR</h3>
        <p>
          Based on guidance from Austria's regulatory authority (RTR KI-Servicestelle), Flowxtra is
          <strong>not classified as a high-risk AI system</strong> under the EU AI Act because:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We do not perform automated decision-making or candidate filtering</li>
          <li>Our AI is used only to assist, not to decide</li>
          <li>We do not process sensitive personal data (Article 9 GDPR categories)</li>
          <li>All AI interactions are transparent and disclosed to users</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Flowxtra complies with Article 50 of the EU AI Act regarding transparency requirements. For
          more information, see the official sources:

        <h3>Your Rights and How to Object</h3>
        <p>
          If you are a job applicant and believe you have been subject to unfair treatment or
          discrimination, you have the right to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Contact the hiring organization directly:</strong> Each job posting on *.flowxtra.com displays a "Contact Person" representing the company. You can submit objections or appeals directly to them.</li>
          <li><strong>Request human review:</strong> You can always request that a human recruiter manually review your application independent of any AI-assisted tools.</li>
          <li><strong>Lodge a complaint:</strong> If you believe your rights under GDPR or the EU AI Act have been violated, you may contact the hiring organization or file a complaint with your local data protection authority.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>AI Service Providers</h3>
        <p>
          We provide AI Products through third-party service providers ("AI Service Providers"). Your
          input and output may be shared with these providers to enable the AI features described above.
          All AI Service Providers are bound by data processing agreements that comply with GDPR Article
          28. For a list of sub-processors, see our
          <a href="https://flowxtra.com/subprocessors" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sub-processors page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          All personal information processed via AI Products is handled in accordance with this Privacy
          Notice and our agreements with third parties to ensure strong security measures and safeguards.

        <h2>7. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>In Short:</strong> If you choose to register or log in using a social media account,
          we may have access to certain information about you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Services let you register or log in using third-party social media account details (e.g.,
          Facebook or X). If you choose to do so, we receive certain profile information from the
          social media provider. The data we receive varies by provider but may include your name,
          email address, friends list, profile picture, and other information you choose to make
          public. If you log in using Facebook, we may also request permissions for items such as your
          friends, check-ins, or likes; you can grant or deny each permission individually.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use social-login data solely for purposes described in this Privacy Notice or otherwise
          disclosed to you within the Services. We do not control how the social media provider uses
          your personal information; we recommend reviewing their privacy notice to understand how
          they collect, use, and share information, and how to manage your privacy preferences on
          their platforms.

        <h2>8. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>In Short:</strong> We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries
          other than your own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our servers are located in Austria, Germany, and Belgium. If you access our Services from
          outside these countries, your information may be transferred to, stored by, and processed in
          our facilities or those of third parties with whom we share data (see Section 4) in
          Australia, the United States, Austria, Belgium, Germany, and other jurisdictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom (UK), or
          Switzerland, please note that these countries may not have data protection laws as stringent
          as those in your home country. Nevertheless, we take appropriate measures to ensure that
          your personal information is protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable
          law.

      <section>
        <h2>9. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the
          purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.
        </p>
        <p>
          We retain personal information only as long as needed for the purposes described, unless a
          longer period is required or permitted by law (e.g., for tax, accounting, or other legal
          requirements). No purpose will require us to keep personal information longer than the
          duration of a user’s account with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we
          delete or anonymise it. If deletion is not possible (for example, because data is stored in
          backup archives), we securely store your information and isolate it from further processing
          until deletion is feasible.
        </p>

        <h2>10. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
          organisational and technical security measures.
        </p>
        <p>
          We implement reasonable technical and organisational safeguards to secure the personal
          information we process. However, no data transmission over the internet or storage
          technology can be guaranteed 100% secure, and we cannot ensure that hackers or other
          unauthorised parties will be unable to defeat our security. You should access the Services
          within a secure environment and understand that transmission of personal information to and
          from our Services is at your own risk.

        <h2>11. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>In Short:</strong> Depending on where you live (for example, the EEA, UK, Switzerland,
          Canada, or certain US states), you may have rights that allow you greater access to and
          control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at
          any time, subject to local laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          In many regions—including the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada—you may have rights to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Request access and obtain a copy of your personal information</li>
          <li>Request rectification or erasure</li>
          <li>Restrict processing</li>
          <li>Request data portability (where applicable)</li>
          <li>Object to certain processing or automated decision-making</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To exercise these rights, contact us using the details under “How Can You Contact Us About
          This Notice?” We will respond in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are in the EEA or UK and believe we are processing your personal information unlawfully,
          you may lodge a complaint with your Member State’s data protection authority. A list is
          available from the European Commission’s directory of national authorities ([European Commission –
          Authorities](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm)). UK
          residents may contact the Information Commissioner’s Office ([ICO Complaint Service](https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/data-protection-complaints/data-protection-complaints/)). Swiss
          residents may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Withdrawing consent:</strong> If we rely on your consent (express or implied) to
          process personal information, you may withdraw that consent at any time. This does not affect
          the lawfulness of processing before withdrawal, nor processing conducted on other legal bases.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Marketing communications:</strong> To opt out of marketing, click the unsubscribe link
          in our emails, reply “STOP” or “UNSUBSCRIBE” to SMS, or contact us via the methods listed in
          “How Can You Contact Us About This Notice?” We may still send service-related messages
          necessary to administer your account or respond to requests.
        </p>
        <h3>Account Information</h3>
        <p>You can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Log in to your account settings to review or update information.</li>
          <li>Contact us using the provided contact details.</li>
          <li>Submit a request via our support portal or help center.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you request account termination, we will deactivate or delete your account and remove
          related data from active databases. We may retain certain information to prevent fraud,
          troubleshoot issues, support investigations, enforce legal terms, or comply with legal
          requirements.

        <h2>12. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and applications include a Do-Not-Track
          (“DNT”) feature that you can activate to signal your preference not to be tracked online.
          Because no uniform standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals currently exists, we do
          not respond to them. If a standard emerges that we must follow, we will describe our
          response in a revised Privacy Notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          California law requires us to disclose how we respond to DNT signals. At present, we do not
          honor DNT browser signals or similar mechanisms.
