      <h1>Flowxtra Sub-processors</h1>
      <p>
        Flowxtra GmbH engages carefully selected sub-processors to support its infrastructure,
        communications, and payment capabilities. Each provider is bound by a written agreement with
        data protection clauses that meet Article 28 GDPR requirements. When a provider stores or
        accesses data outside the EEA, Flowxtra relies on Standard Contractual Clauses or another valid
        transfer mechanism and applies appropriate safeguards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Social platforms connected through Flowxtra's Social Media Manager (such as Meta/Facebook,
        Instagram, LinkedIn, X/Twitter, Google Business Profiles, Snapchat, TikTok, Discord, WhatsApp,
        or Telegram) typically act as independent controllers when you publish content through their
        APIs and therefore are not listed as sub-processors here. Customers should review those
        platforms' privacy terms to understand how they process data associated with shared posts or
        campaigns.
