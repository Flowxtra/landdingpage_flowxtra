    <article>
      <h1>Job Ad Quality Guidelines</h1>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> March 8, 2025</p>
      <p>
        These guidelines apply to all job postings published through Flowxtra, including listings hosted
        on Flowxtra subdomains, customer-connected domains, or any external job boards and social
        networks reached via our distribution tools. These guidelines also apply to all content posted
        through Flowxtra's Social Media Manager feature. By submitting a job or posting content through
        our Services, you agree to comply with the rules below in addition to our Terms of Use, Privacy
        Policy, and applicable platform policies.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Anti-discrimination and respectful content</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Job ads must not discriminate based on protected characteristics (such as age, gender,
          ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, marital status, or any classification
          protected under local law).
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid wording that implies a preference for a particular demographic group unless legally
          justified (for example, bona fide occupational requirements or government programmes).
        </li>
        <li>
          Offensive, harassing, sexually explicit, or violent imagery/language is strictly prohibited.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Authentic and lawful opportunities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Listings must advertise genuine, legal roles. Flowxtra prohibits job scams, “get rich quick”
          offers, illicit services, or postings that encourage illegal conduct.
        </li>
        <li>
          Multilevel marketing schemes, commission-only roles without clear pay structure, or positions
          requiring upfront fees must be transparently disclosed and may be rejected.
        </li>
        <li>
          Freelance or unpaid roles (internships, volunteering, traineeships) must clearly indicate the
          compensation structure or lack thereof.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Promotional and spam controls</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Flowxtra may remove postings that exist primarily to advertise products, drive traffic to
          other sites, or collect leads unrelated to a specific job opening.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not include multiple roles in a single posting. Each vacancy should have its own listing
          with unique responsibilities and requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Excessive reposting or location “blasting” (posting the same job to many locations without
          real openings) is not allowed.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Transparency and accuracy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Provide clear job titles, responsibilities, required qualifications, employment type, and
          location. Avoid clickbait titles, unnecessary punctuation, or misleading claims.
        </li>
        <li>
          Disclose the hiring company name (or state clearly if a recruiting agency is acting on behalf
          of a client). Generic or “confidential” postings may be rejected unless lawfully justified.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you collect applications through Flowxtra, do not redirect candidates to external job
          boards or forms unless the integration is explicitly supported.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Candidate data and security</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Never request sensitive personal data (e.g., national ID numbers, bank details) in the job
          description or initial application unless legally required and appropriately protected.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not request payments from candidates for applications, background checks, or training
          materials. Flowxtra reserves the right to remove any listing that demands money or goods from
          applicants.
        </li>
        <li>
          All processing of candidate information must comply with your applicable privacy laws and our
          Data Processing Agreement.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Compliance with platform and local regulations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When Flowxtra distributes your job to partners (LinkedIn, Meta, Instagram, X/Twitter, Google
          Jobs, Snapchat, Discord communities, WhatsApp Channels, Telegram, or other regional job boards
          and social destinations), you must follow each platform's advertising rules. Flowxtra may edit,
          pause, or remove the ad if it violates partner policies.
        </li>
        <li>
          You are responsible for complying with all applicable labor, advertising, and consumer
          protection laws in the jurisdictions where you recruit, including wage-transparency and equal
          opportunity requirements.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Social Media Manager and content posting</h2>
      <p>
        Flowxtra provides Social Media Manager tools that allow you to publish posts and content to
        platforms such as Meta (Facebook and Instagram), LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter), Google Business
        Profiles, Snapchat, TikTok, Discord, WhatsApp, Telegram, and other integrated networks. When
        using these features, you must comply with the following requirements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Platform-specific policies:</strong> You are responsible for ensuring that all content
          posted through Flowxtra's Social Media Manager complies with each platform's terms of service,
          community guidelines, and advertising policies. This includes restrictions on prohibited
          content, age restrictions, and platform-specific advertising rules.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Content accuracy and authenticity:</strong> All posts must be truthful, accurate, and
          not misleading. Do not use Social Media Manager to publish false information, impersonate
          others, or engage in deceptive practices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prohibited content:</strong> You must not use Social Media Manager to post content that
          is illegal, discriminatory, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or violates intellectual property
          rights. This includes but is not limited to hate speech, spam, phishing attempts, or content
          that promotes illegal activities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Job-related content:</strong> While Social Media Manager can be used for various
          recruitment-related posts, ensure that job postings shared via social media comply with all
          sections of these guidelines, including anti-discrimination requirements and transparency
          standards.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Third-party rights:</strong> You must have the necessary rights and permissions to post
          any content, including images, videos, text, or other materials. Do not post content that
          infringes on copyrights, trademarks, privacy rights, or other intellectual property of third
          parties.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data protection:</strong> When posting content that includes personal information of
          candidates, employees, or other individuals, ensure you have appropriate consent and comply
          with applicable data protection laws, including GDPR and our Data Processing Agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Account security:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the security of your
          social media account credentials connected to Flowxtra. Do not share credentials with
          unauthorized parties, and notify Flowxtra immediately if you suspect unauthorized access.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Platform violations:</strong> If a social media platform removes, restricts, or flags
          content posted through Flowxtra's Social Media Manager due to policy violations, Flowxtra may
          suspend your access to Social Media Manager features or take other appropriate action.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Flowxtra reserves the right to monitor, review, and remove content posted through Social Media
        Manager if it violates these guidelines, platform policies, or applicable laws. Repeated
        violations may result in permanent suspension of Social Media Manager access.
