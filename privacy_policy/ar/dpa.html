      <h1>Data Processing Agreement</h1>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 17, 2024</p>

      <section>
        <h2>1. Scope and Parties</h2>
        <p>
          This Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”) supplements every service agreement concluded between
          Flowxtra GmbH, Wipplingerstraße 20/18, 1010 Vienna, Austria (“Flowxtra” or “Processor”), and
          the customer that subscribes to Flowxtra’s talent acquisition platform (“Customer” or
          “Controller”). The DPA governs all processing of personal data performed by Flowxtra on behalf
          of the Customer within the meaning of Article 28 GDPR and the Austrian Data Protection Act.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
        <p>
          Terms such as “personal data”, “processing”, “data subject”, “controller”, and “processor”
          have the meanings given in Article 4 GDPR. “Sub-processor” means any third party appointed by
          Flowxtra to process personal data on behalf of the Customer. “Applicable law” means GDPR,
          Austrian law, and any national laws that implement or supplement European data protection
          requirements.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Subject Matter, Duration, and Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Flowxtra processes personal data strictly for the purposes described in the underlying
            service agreement, including the provisioning of ATS functionality, candidate communications,
            scoring, assessments, HR consulting, reporting, and integrations that the Customer elects to
            use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Processing begins with activation of Flowxtra services and ends upon full deletion or return
            of Customer data at the Controller’s written instruction, unless retention is required by
            law.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flowxtra acts solely on documented instructions from the Controller. Instructions may be
            issued via the platform, ticketing channels, or by written notice. If Flowxtra believes an
            instruction infringes applicable law, it will promptly inform the Controller.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Categories of Data and Data Subjects</h2>

          <li>
            Optional references, referees, or other third parties whose information is entered by the

        <ul>
          <li>
            Ensure a valid legal basis for each processing activity performed through the Flowxtra
            platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide transparent notices to candidates and employees describing Flowxtra’s involvement as
            a processor.
          </li>

            Configure retention schedules, role-based permissions, and anonymisation settings that align
            with internal policies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Promptly relay instructions relating to data subject requests, deletion, or export.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Obligations of Flowxtra as Processor</h2>
        <p>Flowxtra shall:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Process personal data only on the Controller’s documented instructions, including when
            transferring data to third countries.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure all personnel with access to personal data are bound by confidentiality commitments
            and receive regular privacy training.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implement the technical and organisational measures (TOMs) summarised in <strong>Appendix
            B</strong>. Flowxtra may update TOMs provided that the security level is not degraded.
          </li>
          <li>
            Assist the Controller by providing tools or reasonable support to fulfil obligations related
            to data subject requests, security, breach notifications, and DPIAs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Notify the Controller without undue delay (generally within 48 hours) after becoming aware
            of any personal data breach affecting the Customer’s data, sharing all information necessary
            for regulatory notifications and remediation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Maintain records of processing activities and make them available to supervisory authorities
            upon request.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Job Distribution and Third-Party Platforms</h2>
        <p>
          When the Controller uses Flowxtra's custom-domain or multi-channel distribution features,
          Flowxtra is instructed to transmit job advertisement content (and, where configured by the
          Controller, candidate information) to external job boards, social networks, or marketing
          platforms. Flowxtra also provides Social Media Manager tools that allow the Controller to
          publish posts and content directly to destinations such as Meta/Facebook, Instagram,
          LinkedIn, X/Twitter, Google Business Profiles, Snapchat, Discord, WhatsApp, Telegram, TikTok,
          or other integrated platforms. Flowxtra will only share the data necessary to provide the
          requested integration and will process it strictly in accordance with the Controller's
          documented instructions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Flowxtra limits processing to the minimum data required for publication (job title,
            description, compensation range, location, contact methods, and optional tracking metadata).
          </li>
          <li>
            The Controller is responsible for ensuring that each posting complies with the applicable
            laws, platform policies, and consent requirements of the destination channel and warrants
            that all necessary notices and permissions have been obtained.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flowxtra may suspend or refuse distribution that violates legal or platform requirements.
            Any regulatory inquiries, candidate disputes, or platform penalties arising from the job
            content remain the Controller’s responsibility.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Controller must ensure that all postings comply with Flowxtra's
          <a href="https://flowxtra.com/ad-quality-guidelines">Job Ad Quality Guidelines</a> in addition
          to this DPA.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Electronic Signature Service (E-Signature)</h2>
        <p>
          When the Controller uses Flowxtra's E-Signature Service to create, send, or manage
          employment contracts, offer letters, or other legally binding documents, Flowxtra processes
          personal data on behalf of the Controller as a processor. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Document Content:</strong> The text, terms, and content of contracts and documents
            created or signed through the Service
          </li>
          <li>

            information of all parties who sign documents
          </li>

        <p>
          <strong>Controller Responsibilities:</strong> The Controller is responsible for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ensuring a valid legal basis for processing signatory data (typically performance of a
            contract under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR)
          </li>
          <li>
            Obtaining explicit consent from signatories before sending documents for signature, where
            required by applicable law
          </li>
          <li>
            Providing transparent notices to signatories about the use of the E-Signature Service and
            Flowxtra's role as a processor
          </li>
          <li>
            Verifying the identity of signatories when required by law or for high-value transactions
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensuring that documents are legally permitted to be signed electronically in the relevant
            jurisdiction
          </li>
          <li>
            Complying with applicable data retention laws and internal policies for signed documents
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Processor Obligations:</strong> Flowxtra shall:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Process signatory data only in accordance with the Controller's documented instructions
            and this DPA
          </li>
          <li>
            Implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the integrity and
            confidentiality of signed documents and signature data
          </li>
          <li>
            Maintain comprehensive audit trails documenting all signature actions, which are retained
            in accordance with applicable data retention laws
          </li>
          <li>
            Store signed documents securely and make them accessible to the Controller for the
            duration of the subscription
          </li>
          <li>
            Assist the Controller in responding to data subject requests related to signed documents
            (e.g., access, rectification, deletion)
          </li>
          <li>
            Notify the Controller without undue delay of any personal data breach affecting signature
            data or signed documents
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> The E-Signature Service is designed to comply with
          applicable electronic signature laws, including eIDAS (EU), ESIGN Act (US), and local
          regulations. However, the Controller is responsible for ensuring that electronically signed
          documents are legally valid and enforceable in their specific jurisdiction and for their
          particular use case. Flowxtra does not provide legal advice regarding the enforceability of
          electronic signatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          For detailed terms governing the use of the E-Signature Service, see Section 27A of Flowxtra's
          Terms of Use.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Sub-processors</h2>
        <p>
          Flowxtra relies on carefully vetted sub-processors to deliver parts of the service (hosting,
          analytics, messaging, background infrastructure). The current list is available in
          <strong>Appendix C</strong>. Flowxtra will notify the Controller of intended changes at least
          30 days in advance via email or the platform. The Controller may object on reasonable data
          protection grounds. If the parties cannot agree on a mitigation plan, the Controller may
          terminate the affected service by giving 30 days’ notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flowxtra imposes the same data protection obligations on each sub-processor through written
          agreements aligned with Article 28 GDPR. Flowxtra remains fully liable for the performance of
          sub-processors.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>8. International Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          Where personal data is transferred outside the EEA/UK/Switzerland, Flowxtra relies on a
          legally recognised transfer mechanism, such as adequacy decisions, EU Standard Contractual
          Clauses (2021/914), or UK Addenda. Supplementary measures, including encryption and access
          limitations, are applied where required by the Schrems II ruling. Documentation is available
          upon request.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>9. Data Subject Rights</h2>
        <p>
          Flowxtra provides in-product functionality that enables the Controller to search, export,
          rectify, anonymise, or delete data subject records. Where the Controller cannot self-serve,
          Flowxtra will, upon request, provide reasonable assistance without undue delay and at no
          additional cost unless the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>10. Security Incidents</h2>
        <p>
          Flowxtra maintains an incident response plan, including 24/7 monitoring, logging, and root
          cause analysis. After notifying the Controller of a breach, Flowxtra will provide regular
          updates until containment and remediation are complete. The Controller is responsible for
          notifying supervisory authorities and affected data subjects unless the parties agree
          otherwise in writing.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>11. Audits and Certifications</h2>
        <p>
          Flowxtra makes available audit summaries, penetration test reports, and attestations (e.g.,
          ISO/IEC certifications) subject to confidentiality. Upon 30 days’ written notice, the
          Controller may conduct an audit of Flowxtra’s processing activities once every 12 months, or
          more frequently when required by supervisory authorities. Audits shall be carried out during
          normal business hours, avoid disruption, and may involve a mutually agreed independent third
          party. Each party bears its own costs.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>12. Return and Deletion</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            During the subscription, the Controller can export personal data at any time using
            self-service exports or APIs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Within 60 days after termination, Flowxtra will make the final export available upon written
            request. After the export window closes, Flowxtra will begin secure deletion or
            pseudonymisation of Customer data from active systems and backups according to defined
            retention schedules (generally within 90 additional days, except where legal obligations
            require retention).
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>13. Liability and Indemnity</h2>
        <p>
          Each party is responsible for damages caused by its own breach of this DPA or applicable data
          protection law. Liability caps and exclusions set out in the main service agreement apply to
          this DPA. Nothing limits obligations under Article 82 GDPR regarding joint liability toward
          data subjects.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>14. Order of Precedence</h2>
        <p>
          In the event of a conflict between this DPA and the service agreement, the DPA prevails for
          all matters concerning personal data processing. If any provision is invalid or unenforceable,
          the remainder remains in effect and the parties will replace the invalid provision with one
          that reflects the original intent as closely as possible.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>15. Governing Law and Forum</h2>
        <p>
          This DPA is governed by Austrian law. Exclusive place of jurisdiction is Vienna, Austria, to
          the extent permitted by applicable law.
