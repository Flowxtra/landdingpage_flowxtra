      <h1>GDPR Compliance Statement</h1>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> March 8, 2025</p>
      <p>
        This page summarizes how Flowxtra GmbH (“Flowxtra”, “we”, “us”) complies with the European
        Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”). Flowxtra is headquartered at
        Wipplingerstraße 20/18, 1010 Vienna, Austria, and acts as either a data controller or data
        processor depending on the service being provided.
      </p>

      <h2>Legal bases for processing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contractual necessity:</strong> Delivering ATS, recruiting, and scheduling features.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> Securing systems, preventing fraud, improving services.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Marketing emails, optional cookies, talent-pool subscriptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal obligation:</strong> Accounting, tax, and employment-related requirements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Electronic Signature Service:</strong> When Flowxtra processes personal data in
        connection with the E-Signature Service (e.g., signatory information, signature data, audit
        trails), the primary legal basis is <strong>contractual necessity</strong> (Article 6(1)(b)
        GDPR), as the processing is necessary to perform the contract between Flowxtra and the customer
        and to enable the signing of employment contracts or other legally binding documents. In some
        cases, <strong>legal obligation</strong> (Article 6(1)(c) GDPR) may apply where retention of
        signed documents and audit trails is required by employment, tax, or commercial law. Flowxtra
        acts as a processor when providing the E-Signature Service, processing data on behalf of the
        customer (controller) in accordance with Article 28 GDPR. For more information, see our Data
        Processing Agreement and Section 27A of our Terms of Use.
      </p>

      <h2>Social Media Manager and publishing</h2>
      <p>
        Flowxtra's Social Media Manager allows customers to publish recruitment content and job ads
        directly to third-party platforms such as Meta (Facebook and Instagram), LinkedIn, X/Twitter,
        Google Business Profiles, Snapchat, TikTok, Discord, WhatsApp Channels, Telegram, and similar
        destinations. When we process personal data for this feature, the legal basis is usually
        <strong>contractual necessity</strong> (Article 6(1)(b)) for delivering the requested service,
        combined with <strong>legitimate interests</strong> in providing secure distribution tooling.
        Customers are responsible for ensuring that each post complies with the destination platform's
        policies, local employment laws, and user consent requirements. Flowxtra may pause or remove
        campaigns that breach the <a href="https://flowxtra.com/ad-quality-guidelines">Job Ad Quality
        Guidelines</a> or applicable platform rules.
      </p>

      <h2>Data subject rights</h2>
      <p>Individuals may exercise the rights provided in Articles 12–23 GDPR:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access, rectification, and deletion of personal data.</li>
        <li>Restriction or objection to processing.</li>
        <li>Portability of data supplied under consent or contract.</li>
        <li>Withdrawal of consent at any time without affecting prior processing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Requests can be submitted via <a href="mailto:privacy@flowxtra.com">privacy@flowxtra.com</a>
        or our <a href="/data-request">data request form</a>. We respond within one month (Article 12).
      </p>

      <h2>Security measures</h2>
      <p>
        Flowxtra implements appropriate technical and organisational measures under Article 32 GDPR,
        including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>AES-256 encryption at rest and TLS 1.2+ in transit.</li>
        <li>Role-based access control, SSO/MFA, logging, and monitoring.</li>
        <li>ISO 27001-certified cloud infrastructure and redundant backups.</li>
        <li>Incident response and breach notification procedures (Articles 33–34).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sub-processors</h2>
      <p>
        Flowxtra maintains a list of authorised sub-processors at
        <a href="/subprocessors">flowxtra.com/subprocessors</a>. Each provider is bound by a Data
        Processing Agreement and, where relevant, Standard Contractual Clauses.
      </p>

      <h2>International data transfers</h2>
      <p>
        When personal data leaves the EEA/UK/Switzerland, we rely on SCCs (2021/914), adequacy
        decisions, or other valid transfer mechanisms. Supplemental measures such as encryption and
        access restrictions are applied following the EDPB recommendations (Schrems II).
