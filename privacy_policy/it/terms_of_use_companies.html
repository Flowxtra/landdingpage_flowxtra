        </p>
        <p>
          Supplemental terms and documents posted from time to time on the Services are incorporated by
          reference. We may amend these Legal Terms at our discretion by updating the “Last updated”

        <h2>21. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
        <h3>Informal Negotiations</h3>
        <p>
          To expedite resolution and control costs, the Parties agree to attempt to negotiate any

          Any Dispute arising out of or in connection with these Legal Terms shall be referred to and
          finally resolved by the International Commercial Arbitration Court under the European
          Arbitration Chamber (Belgium, Brussels, Avenue Louise 146) pursuant to its Rules. The number
          of arbitrators shall be one (1). The seat of arbitration shall be Vienna, Austria. The
          language of the proceedings shall be English. The governing law shall be the substantive law

          The following Disputes are exempt from informal negotiations and arbitration: (a) Disputes
          concerning a Party’s intellectual property rights; (b) Disputes alleging theft, piracy,
          invasion of privacy, or unauthorised use; and (c) claims for injunctive relief. If any part of

        <h3>Document Storage and Retention</h3>
        <p>
          Signed documents are stored securely in your Flowxtra account and are accessible to you
          for the duration of your subscription. Upon termination of your account, you are
          responsible for downloading and retaining copies of all signed documents. Flowxtra may
          retain signed documents for a limited period after account termination as required by law
          or for dispute resolution purposes, but you should not rely on Flowxtra as your sole
          repository for important legal documents.
        </p>

        <h3>Limitations and Exclusions</h3>
        <p>
          The E-Signature Service may not be suitable for all types of documents. You acknowledge
          that certain documents may require physical signatures or additional authentication
          methods under applicable law, including but not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wills, codicils, and testamentary trusts</li>
          <li>Certain real estate transactions (varies by jurisdiction)</li>
          <li>Court orders, official court documents, or documents requiring notarization</li>
          <li>Certain family law documents (e.g., adoption papers, divorce decrees)</li>
          <li>Documents governed by laws that explicitly prohibit electronic signatures</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You are responsible for determining whether electronic signatures are legally acceptable
          for your specific documents and use cases. Flowxtra does not provide legal advice and
          recommends consulting with legal counsel for high-value or complex transactions.
        </p>

        <h3>Warranties and Disclaimers</h3>
        <p>
          Flowxtra provides the E-Signature Service "as is" and makes no warranties regarding the
          legal enforceability of electronically signed documents in your specific jurisdiction or
          for your particular use case. Flowxtra does not guarantee that electronically signed
          documents will be accepted by third parties, courts, or government agencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          You acknowledge that the legal validity and enforceability of electronic signatures may
          vary by jurisdiction and document type. Flowxtra is not liable for any disputes, claims,
          or losses arising from the use or non-acceptance of electronically signed documents.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Protection and Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          The processing of personal data in connection with the E-Signature Service is governed by
          our Privacy Policy and, where applicable, our Data Processing Agreement. When you use the
          E-Signature Service, you may process personal data of signatories (e.g., names, email
          addresses, signatures, IP addresses). You are responsible for ensuring that you have a
          lawful basis for processing such data and that you comply with applicable data protection
          laws, including GDPR.
        </p>

        <h3>Termination and Suspension</h3>
        <p>
          Flowxtra reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the E-Signature Service
          if you violate these Terms, use the service for illegal purposes, or engage in fraudulent
          activity. Upon termination, you will retain access to previously signed documents for a
          limited period to download copies, after which access may be restricted.
