      <h1>COOKIE POLICY</h1>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 17, 2024</p>

      <p>
        This Cookie Policy explains how Flowxtra GmbH (“Company,” “we,” “us,” “our”) uses cookies and
        similar technologies to recognize you when you visit
        <a href="https://flowxtra.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://flowxtra.com</a>
        (“Website”). It explains why we use these technologies, the rights you have to control them,
        and how certain cookies may involve personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, we may use cookies to collect personal information—or combine cookie data with
        other information to make it personal.
      </p>

      <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small data files placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a
        website. Website owners use cookies to make their sites function properly, improve efficiency,
        and provide reporting information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies set by Flowxtra are “first-party cookies.” Cookies set by third parties are “third-party
        cookies” and enable additional functionality (e.g., advertising, interactive content,
        analytics). These third parties can recognize your device across different websites.
      </p>

      <h2>Why do we use cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are essential for
        technical reasons—we call these “strictly necessary” cookies. Others help us track and target
        user interests to enhance the experience. Third parties may serve cookies for advertising,
        analytics, and other purposes (described further below).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you use Flowxtra's Social Media Manager to publish posts or job ads to platforms such as
        Meta (Facebook and Instagram), LinkedIn, X/Twitter, Google Business Profiles, Snapchat, TikTok,
        Discord, WhatsApp Channels, Telegram, or other supported destinations, those platforms may set
        their own pixels or cookies to measure delivery and performance. These third-party cookies are
        controlled by the respective platform and are subject to their privacy policies. We only enable
        these integrations at your request, and you can disable them at any time in the campaign or
        integration settings.
      </p>

      <h2>How can I control cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        You can accept or reject cookies using our Cookie Consent Manager, which appears in the
        notification banner and is available on our Website. The manager lets you choose which cookie
        categories to accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected, because they are required
        for services.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you reject cookies, you may still use our Website, but some functionality or areas may be
        limited. You can also adjust browser settings to accept or refuse cookies.
      </p>

      <h2>How to withdraw cookie consent</h2>
      <p>
        You can withdraw or change your cookie consent at any time. Withdrawing consent is as easy
        as giving it. You have multiple options:
      </p>

      <h3>Option 1: Using the Cookie Preferences Button</h3>
      <p>
        Click the "Manage Cookies" or "Cookie Preferences" button located at the bottom-right
        corner of our Website. This will open the cookie preferences panel where you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Turn off specific cookie categories (Functional, Analytics, Marketing)</li>
        <li>Click "Accept Necessary Only" to withdraw consent for all non-essential cookies</li>
        <li>View which cookies are currently active</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Option 2: Clear Your Browser Data</h3>
      <p>
        You can delete all cookies stored by Flowxtra by clearing your browser's cookies and site
        data. Note that this will also remove your consent preferences, and the banner will appear
        again on your next visit.
      </p>

      <h3>Option 3: Contact Us</h3>
      <p>
        If you prefer, you can contact us directly to withdraw your cookie consent:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Email: <a href="mailto:privacy@flowxtra.com">privacy@flowxtra.com</a></li>
        <li>Subject: "Withdraw Cookie Consent"</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> Withdrawing consent for essential cookies may affect the
        functionality of our Website. You can always grant consent again by clicking "Accept
        Cookies" in the banner.
      </p>

      <h3>Targeting cookies</h3>
      <p>
        These cookies are used to deliver personalized advertisements and track advertising campaign performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you publish content through Social Media Manager, the connected platforms may use their own
        targeting or conversion cookies (for example Meta Pixel, LinkedIn Insight Tag, TikTok Pixel,
        Google Ads conversion tags, Snapchat Pixel, Discord tracking webhooks, or WhatsApp/Telegram
        analytics) to measure engagement, detect fraud, or optimize delivery. Flowxtra only triggers
        these pixels when you have enabled the relevant integration, and you can disable them by
        disconnecting the account or adjusting cookie preferences.

      <h2>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</h2>

        Cookies are not the only way we recognize or track visitors. We may also use technologies such
        as web beacons (also known as tracking pixels or clear gifs). These tiny graphics files include
        unique identifiers that let us know when specific pages are visited or when emails containing
        them are opened. Web beacons help us observe navigation patterns, deliver or communicate with
        cookies, determine whether you arrived via third-party ads, improve site performance, and
        measure email campaign success. Because web beacons often rely on cookies, declining cookies may
        limit their functionality.

      <h2>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</h2>
      <p>
        Some websites employ “Flash Cookies” (Local Shared Objects or LSOs) to store information about
        service usage, support fraud prevention, or keep certain operations running. If you prefer not
        to allow Flash Cookies, adjust Adobe Flash Player settings via the
        <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >Website Storage Settings Panel</a
        >
        or manage them globally through the

          >Global Storage Settings Panel</a
        >. These tools explain how to delete existing LSOs, prevent new ones from being added without
        consent, and block third-party Flash Cookies. Restricting LSOs may limit the functionality of
        Flash applications, including those embedded in our services.
