  <section id="why-flowxtra-best">
    <h2>Why Flowxtra is the Best Value ATS in 2026</h2>

    <h3>No Hidden Costs or Surprise Charges</h3>

    <h3>Powerful Features at Every Price Point</h3>
    <p>Even Flowxtra's entry-level plans include features that competitors reserve for enterprise tiers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Journey Flow automation (€99/month Basic plan) - competitors charge $300+ for workflow automation</li>
      <li>White-label branding (€99/month) - typically an enterprise-only feature elsewhere</li>
      <li>Client management for agencies (€99/month) - usually requires custom enterprise pricing</li>

  </section>

  <section id="how-to-choose">
    <h2>How to Choose the Right ATS Recruiting Software</h2>
    <p>Selecting the best <a href="https://flowxtra.com/en/ats-recruiting-software">recruiting software</a> for your organization requires careful consideration of multiple factors. Here's a comprehensive framework to guide your decision:</p>

    <h3>1. Assess Your Company Size and Hiring Volume</h3>
    <p>Different ATS solutions are optimized for different scales of operation. A startup hiring 5-10 people per year has very different needs than an enterprise hiring hundreds of employees across multiple locations.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Small businesses (1-50 employees)</strong>: Look for affordable, easy-to-implement solutions like Flowxtra or JazzHR</li>
      <li><strong>Mid-size companies (51-500 employees)</strong>: Consider feature-rich platforms like Workable or Lever</li>
      <li><strong>Enterprise (500+ employees)</strong>: Explore comprehensive systems like Greenhouse or iCIMS</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Evaluate Essential Features</h3>
    <p>Create a prioritized list of must-have features versus nice-to-have capabilities. Essential features typically include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Multi-channel job posting capabilities</li>
      <li>Resume parsing and candidate database</li>
      <li>Customizable hiring workflows</li>
      <li>Team collaboration tools</li>
      <li>Interview scheduling automation</li>
      <li>Mobile accessibility</li>
      <li>Reporting and analytics</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Consider Integration Requirements</h3>
    <p>Your ATS should integrate seamlessly with your existing technology stack. Check for <a href="https://flowxtra.com/en/app-store">integrations</a> with:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>HRIS and payroll systems</li>
      <li>Email platforms (Gmail, Outlook)</li>
      <li>Calendar applications</li>
      <li>Background check services</li>
      <li>Assessment tools</li>
      <li>Video interviewing platforms</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Budget Appropriately</h3>
    <p>ATS pricing varies significantly based on features, user count, and company size. Consider both upfront costs and long-term value:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Free (€0)</strong>: <a href="https://flowxtra.com/en">Flowxtra</a> - Only ATS with unlimited job postings on free plan</li>
      <li><strong>Budget-friendly</strong>: €30-€99/month (Flowxtra paid plans, JazzHR)</li>
      <li><strong>Mid-range</strong>: $149-$300/month (Workable, Lever)</li>
      <li><strong>Premium</strong>: Custom enterprise pricing (Greenhouse, iCIMS)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With <a href="https://flowxtra.com/en">Flowxtra</a>, you can start completely free with no credit card required and unlimited job postings. This eliminates financial risk and allows you to test the platform with real recruiting workflows before committing to a paid plan. Remember to factor in hidden costs like job board fees, user limits, and storage caps when comparing <a href="https://flowxtra.com/en/pricing">pricing plans</a>.</p>

    <h3>5. Prioritize User Experience</h3>
    <p>The best recruiting software is one that your team will actually use. During your evaluation:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Request demos and test the interface yourself</li>
      <li>Involve hiring managers and recruiters in the evaluation</li>
      <li>Test the candidate-facing experience</li>
      <li>Assess mobile functionality</li>
      <li>Review the learning curve and training requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Verify Customer Support Quality</h3>
    <p>When recruiting challenges arise, responsive customer support is crucial. Evaluate:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Support channels available (phone, email, chat)</li>
      <li>Response time commitments</li>
      <li>Knowledge base and documentation quality</li>
      <li>Training and onboarding support</li>
      <li>User community and forums</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7. Review Compliance and Security Features</h3>
    <p>Ensure your chosen ATS helps maintain compliance with employment regulations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>EEOC reporting capabilities</li>
      <li>GDPR compliance for international hiring</li>
      <li>Data encryption and security measures</li>
      <li>Audit trails and record retention</li>
      <li>Access controls and permissions</li>
    </ul>
