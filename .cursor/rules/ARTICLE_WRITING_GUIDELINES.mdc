## 📄 HTML Article Format & Structure

### IMPORTANT: All Articles Must Be Written in HTML

Every article **MUST** be written in clean, semantic HTML code (source code format). This allows for:
- Direct integration into the website
- Proper keyword linking with anchor tags
- Full control over formatting and SEO elements
- Easy implementation of schema markup

### ⚠️ Table of Contents - AUTO-GENERATED

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT manually create a Table of Contents section in your articles.

The website system **automatically generates** the Table of Contents from all **H2 headings** in your article.

**What you need to do:**
1. ✅ Use clear, descriptive **H2 headings** for main sections
2. ✅ Make sure H2 headings include relevant keywords
3. ✅ Order your H2 headings logically (they become the TOC)
4. ❌ Do NOT create `<nav class="table-of-contents">` manually
5. ❌ Do NOT add any TOC HTML code

**Example:**
```html
<article>
  <section class="introduction">
    <p>Your introduction here...</p>
  </section>

  <!-- TOC will be AUTO-GENERATED from the H2 headings below -->

  <section>
    <h2>What is ATS Software?</h2>  <!-- This becomes TOC item 1 -->
    <p>Content here...</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Top 10 ATS Solutions</h2>  <!-- This becomes TOC item 2 -->
    <p>Content here...</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How to Choose the Right ATS</h2>  <!-- This becomes TOC item 3 -->
    <p>Content here...</p>
  </section>
</article>
```

The system will automatically generate a clickable Table of Contents like:
- What is ATS Software?
- Top 10 ATS Solutions
- How to Choose the Right ATS

### HTML Article Template

```html
<!-- Article Content in HTML Format -->
<article class="blog-post">

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section class="introduction">
    <p>Your engaging introduction paragraph with the <a href="https://flowxtra.com/ats-recruiting-software">primary keyword linked</a> in the first 100 words...</p>

  <!-- Main Content Sections -->

## 🔗 Keyword Linking Rules (CRITICAL)

### Automatic Keyword Linking Strategy

**EVERY time you mention these keywords, you MUST add the corresponding link:**

#### Primary Keywords → Main Service Pages

| **Keyword Phrase** | **Link To** | **Example HTML** |
|-------------------|-------------|------------------|
| ATS software, ATS system, applicant tracking system | https://flowxtra.com/ats-recruiting-software | `<a href="https://flowxtra.com/ats-recruiting-software">ATS software</a>` |
| recruiting software, recruitment software | https://flowxtra.com/ats-recruiting-software | `<a href="https://flowxtra.com/ats-recruiting-software">recruiting software</a>` |
| social media management, social media recruiting | https://flowxtra.com/social-media-management | `<a href="https://flowxtra.com/social-media-management">social media management</a>` |
| free job posting, post jobs free | https://flowxtra.com/free-job-posting | `<a href="https://flowxtra.com/free-job-posting">free job posting</a>` |

#### Secondary Keywords → Support Pages

| **Keyword Phrase** | **Link To** | **Example HTML** |
|-------------------|-------------|------------------|
| pricing, cost, price plans | https://flowxtra.com/pricing | `<a href="https://flowxtra.com/pricing">pricing plans</a>` |
| integrations, app integrations, connect apps | https://flowxtra.com/app-store | `<a href="https://flowxtra.com/app-store">integrations</a>` |
| contact us, get in touch, reach out | https://flowxtra.com/contact-us | `<a href="https://flowxtra.com/contact-us">contact us</a>` |
| about Flowxtra, about us | https://flowxtra.com/about | `<a href="https://flowxtra.com/about">about Flowxtra</a>` |

#### Action Keywords → User Portal

| **Keyword Phrase** | **Link To** | **Example HTML** |
|-------------------|-------------|------------------|
| sign up, register, create account, get started | https://my.flowxtra.com/registration | `<a href="https://my.flowxtra.com/registration">sign up today</a>` |
| log in, login, sign in | https://my.flowxtra.com/login | `<a href="https://my.flowxtra.com/login">log in</a>` |
| try Flowxtra, start free trial | https://my.flowxtra.com/registration | `<a href="https://my.flowxtra.com/registration">start your free trial</a>` |

### Linking Best Practices

1. **First Mention Only**: Link the keyword the FIRST time it appears in each section (not every single occurrence)
2. **Natural Anchor Text**: Use natural, contextual anchor text (not just naked keywords)
3. **Open in Same Window**: Use `target="_self"` or no target attribute (keep users on site)
4. **Descriptive Links**: Make link text descriptive and valuable
5. **Avoid Over-Linking**: Maximum 1 link per 150 words to avoid looking spammy

### Examples of Good vs Bad Linking

#### ❌ Bad Example (Over-linking, Unnatural)
```html
<p>Our <a href="https://flowxtra.com/ats-recruiting-software">ATS software</a> is the best
<a href="https://flowxtra.com/ats-recruiting-software">ATS software</a> for small businesses.
The <a href="https://flowxtra.com/ats-recruiting-software">ATS software</a> helps you hire faster.</p>
```

#### ✅ Good Example (Natural, First Mention)
```html
<p>Finding the right <a href="https://flowxtra.com/ats-recruiting-software">ATS software</a> can
transform your hiring process. An applicant tracking system streamlines recruitment from job posting
to onboarding, helping you find top talent faster and more efficiently.</p>
```

---

## 🌐 Locale-Specific Linking

### Adjust Links Based on Article Locale

When writing for specific countries, use the locale-specific URLs:

#### English Locales
```html
<!-- US Article -->
<a href="https://flowxtra.com/en-us/ats-recruiting-software">ATS software</a>

<!-- UK Article -->
<a href="https://flowxtra.com/en-gb/ats-recruiting-software">ATS software</a>

- Show expertise through detailed, accurate information
- Build authority with data, statistics, and industry insights
- Establish trust with honest comparisons and transparent information

<!-- etc. -->
```

## ✍️ Writing Style Guidelines

### Voice & Tone
- **Professional but Conversational**: Like a knowledgeable friend
- **Active Voice**: "Flowxtra helps recruiters" NOT "Recruiters are helped by Flowxtra"

- **One Idea Per Sentence**: Keep it simple and clear
- **Transition Words**: Use "however," "therefore," "additionally," etc.

### Paragraph Rules

- **Length**: 2-4 sentences maximum
- **Whitespace**: Leave blank line between paragraphs
- **Focus**: One main idea per paragraph

### Power Words to Use
- **Authority**: proven, certified, expert, professional, leading
- **Trust**: guaranteed, secure, verified, trusted, authentic
- **Value**: free, best, ultimate, complete, essential
- **Urgency**: now, today, limited, exclusive, new
- **Results**: increase, boost, improve, optimize, streamline

### Words to Avoid
- "Very," "really," "just," "actually" (filler words)
